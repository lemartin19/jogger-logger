          This is a personal project to make it easier to combine the historical tracking and
          analysis of Strava with an interface to plan your future training. Knowing how you've
          gotten to where you are is part of knowing how to get where you want to go, so this tool
          makes it easier to see your past and future training cycles all in one place! Get after it
          and use it how you want!
